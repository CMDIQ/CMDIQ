# CMDIQ – Unified Command Center for IT Admins 🛠️

CMDIQ is an open-source blueprint for a future-facing IT admin platform.  
It unifies device management, analytics, automation, remote support, and AI into a single-pane dashboard.

This project is not a product. It's a concept drop.  
**Built by an admin, for admins.** Free to clone, modify, and extend.
